                        is a Japanese virtual YouTuber. She began posting videos as an independent creator in March 2018. 
                        In May 2019, she became affiliated with Hololive Production through their newly-created music 
                        label, INoNaKa Music, before joining the agency's main branch later the same year.
                        Her activity consists primarily of live streaming herself singing karaoke, playing video games, 
                        or talking to her fans.                       
                        She is particularly well-known among fans for her skill at Tetris and 
                        her singing ability."

                        streams, and her viewers used to view her as a pure person. However, during a stream 
                        collaboration with various Hololive members, she was shown to have a remorseless and 
                        sociopathic personality while still giving off a carefree attitude when she was killing 
                        and hunting out people. Over time, people started to refer to this side of her as 
                        "Psychopath Suisei", with her denying it as a side of her."
